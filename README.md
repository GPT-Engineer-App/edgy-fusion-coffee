# edgy-fusion-coffee

Craft a website that screams funky and edgy for a coffee place beloved by bikers. Embrace a design that's as bold and dynamic as the biking and coffee community it serves, utilizing the Chakra UI component library for its customizable components and responsive design capabilities.

Color Scheme and Typography
Primary Colors: Electric blue (#0077FF) and neon green (#39FF14) to capture attention and evoke a sense of energy and excitement. Accents in hot pink (#FF1493) to add a pop of fun and vibrance.
Secondary Colors: Matte black (#121212) for backgrounds, creating a bold contrast that makes the neon colors stand out even more.
Typography: Choose a mix of graffiti-style fonts for headings to channel the street art vibe and a clean, sans-serif for body text to keep the content readable and sharp.
Imagery and Graphics
Incorporate eclectic, high-energy images showcasing the fusion of coffee culture and biking: think espresso shots with a blur of a bike race in the background or a helmet with coffee beans reflected in the visor.
Use graphic elements like splashes, streaks, and graffiti tags to frame content sections and buttons, enhancing the edgy feel.
Layout and Components
Header: A dynamic, floating navigation bar featuring the logo and menu items. Integrate a neon light effect for hover states to boost the edgy aesthetic.
Hero Section: A bold, animated collage of cycling and coffee imagery, overlaid with glitchy, neon-outlined text introducing the shop and a "Dive In" CTA button.
About Section: Display the shop's story through a split-screen design, combining video clips of bike stunts and coffee art with parallax scrolling effects.
Menu Section: Use Chakra's Grid component to lay out the coffee menu in a zine-like format, with each item accompanied by playful, distorted images and funky typography.
Events Calendar: Showcase upcoming events in a carousel with graphic stickers and badges for different types of events (bike races, coffee tastings, art jams).
Footer: Craft a footer with a graffiti wall texture background, including social media links styled as spray-paint cans and a newsletter signup with a neon outline.
Interactive Elements
Employ Chakra's Popover component for surprise facts about coffee and biking, popping up in random, unexpected places on the site.
Interactive gallery using the Chakra Slider for customer photos and event highlights, with drag-and-graffiti-swipe controls.
A funky, interactive quiz to find your perfect coffee blend, styled with Chakra's Radio buttons that glow when selected and submit button that pulses with a neon shadow.
